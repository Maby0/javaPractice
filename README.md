# Product Scanner exercise

In this exercise you will implement the Product Scanner exercise described in the
"Learning Objectives - Hello Java!" section of the wiki.

A skeleton version of the project has been set up on Github at git@github.com:markschnitzius/ProductScannerExercise.git.
So you can create the project by selecting "File | New | Project from Version Control":

![New Project from Version Control](doc/createproj.png)

And paste in the github URL:

![Get from Version Control](doc/getfromversioncontrol.png)

You'll need to also give it the directory where you want to save the project locally.
