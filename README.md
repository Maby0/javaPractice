# Product Scanner exercise

In this exercise you will implement the Product Scanner exercise described in the
"Learning Objectives - Hello Java!" section of the wiki.

A skeleton version of the project has been set up on Github at git@github.com:markschnitzius/ProductScannerExercise.git.
So you can create the project by selecting "File | New | Project from Version Control":

![New Project from Version Control](doc/createproj.png)

And paste in the github URL:

![Get from Version Control](doc/getfromversioncontrol.png)

You'll need to also give it the directory where you want to save the project locally.
After clicking Clone, you should be able to view the project structure in the Project
view pane on the left.  Click around and have a look:
